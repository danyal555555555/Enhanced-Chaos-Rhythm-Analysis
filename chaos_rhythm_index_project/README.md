# Chaos Rhythm Index (CRI) - Enhanced Model
This project introduces the **Chaos Rhythm Index (CRI)** and its enhanced version for analyzing chaotic systems. The CRI is designed to measure and predict chaotic behavior, with improved features for noise resistance and better identification of equilibrium points (Chaos Twins).

## 📋 Overview
This project includes:

✅ Original CRI model for detecting chaotic patterns.  
✅ Enhanced CRI model with improved accuracy and noise resistance.  
✅ Visual comparison between the two models.  
✅ Adaptive Sliding Mode Control (SMC) using the enhanced CRI.
